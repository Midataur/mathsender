  <h2>Welcome to MathSender!</h2>

  <p>
    MathSender is a tool designed to help teachers ask maths questions to
    students during online learning. Born out of how garbage sending equations
    via Webex text chat is, MathSender provides a way to send beautiful
    \(\LaTeX\) based expressions in real time via a question and answer system.
